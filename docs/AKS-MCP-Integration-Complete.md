# AKS MCP Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview
The Azure AI Agent now has comprehensive AKS cluster inspection capabilities through the new AKS MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## What Was Added

### 1. AksMcpPlugin.cs
- **Purpose**: Deep AKS cluster inspection using Kubernetes API
- **Location**: `AzureAIAgent.Plugins/AksMcpPlugin.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Connect to AKS clusters using kubeconfig from Terraform
  - Get comprehensive cluster overview (nodes, pods, services)
  - List and inspect pods with status and health information
  - List and inspect services with endpoints and load balancer info
  - Get pod logs for troubleshooting applications
  - Execute any kubectl command for advanced cluster management

### 2. AzureResourcePlugin Integration
- **Integration**: Added AKS MCP function wrappers to main plugin
- **Location**: `AzureAIAgent.Plugins/AzureResourcePlugin.cs`
- **Functions Added**:
  - `ConnectToAksClusterAsync`
  - `GetAksClusterOverviewAsync`
  - `GetAksPodsAsync`
  - `GetAksServicesAsync`
  - `GetAksLogsAsync`
  - `ExecuteKubectlCommandAsync`

### 3. Enhanced AI System Prompt
- **Location**: `AzureAIAgent.Core/Class1.cs`
- **Added**: Comprehensive AKS inspection capabilities documentation
- **Features**:
  - Instructions for when to offer AKS inspection
  - Workflow guidance for cluster management
  - Example commands and use cases

### 4. Package Dependencies
- **Added**: KubernetesClient v13.0.37 to AzureAIAgent.Plugins project
- **Purpose**: Kubernetes API access for deep cluster inspection

## AKS MCP Functions Available

### Core Functions
1. **ConnectToAksCluster**: Connect to AKS cluster using Terraform kubeconfig
2. **GetAksClusterOverview**: Get nodes, pods, services overview
3. **GetAksPods**: List pods with status, filter by namespace/problems
4. **GetAksServices**: List services with endpoints and load balancer info
5. **GetAksLogs**: Get pod logs with configurable line count
6. **ExecuteKubectlCommand**: Execute any kubectl command

### Usage Workflow
1. Deploy AKS cluster using existing Terraform functionality
2. Connect to cluster: `ConnectToAksCluster(deploymentName, terraformDirectory)`
3. Inspect cluster: Use any of the inspection functions
4. Troubleshoot: Get logs, check pod status, inspect services

## AI Capabilities Enhancement

The AI agent now can:
- **Immediately offer cluster inspection** after successful AKS deployment
- **Provide real-time cluster health** and application status
- **Help troubleshoot deployment issues** by examining pod logs and events
- **Offer comprehensive cluster management** beyond infrastructure provisioning
- **Execute custom kubectl commands** for advanced operations

## Example User Interactions

After AKS deployment:
```
AI: "Your AKS cluster is ready! Would you like me to:
â€¢ Show cluster overview (nodes, pods, services)
â€¢ Check pod status and logs
â€¢ Inspect services and ingress configurations
â€¢ Execute custom kubectl commands"
```

For troubleshooting:
```
User: "Show me what's running in my cluster"
AI: [Calls GetAksClusterOverview to show comprehensive cluster state]

User: "Get logs from nginx-pod"
AI: [Calls GetAksLogs to show recent pod logs]

User: "List all services"
AI: [Calls GetAksServices to show all services with endpoints]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **AksMcpPlugin**: Core Kubernetes operations using k8s .NET client
- **AzureResourcePlugin**: Wrapper functions with consistent parameter patterns
- **AI System Prompt**: Enhanced with AKS inspection guidance and workflows

### Kubernetes Client Integration
- Uses official Kubernetes .NET client (KubernetesClient v13.0.37)
- Configures from Terraform-generated kubeconfig files
- Supports all standard Kubernetes operations (get, describe, logs, etc.)

### State Management
- Maintains Kubernetes client connections per deployment
- Integrates with existing Terraform state management
- Preserves connection context across AI agent sessions

## Benefits Delivered

1. **Complete Infrastructure Lifecycle**: From provisioning to ongoing management
2. **Deep Cluster Visibility**: Beyond just infrastructure creation
3. **Integrated Troubleshooting**: Seamless transition from deployment to operations
4. **Kubectl-like Capabilities**: Full Kubernetes management through AI interface
5. **Smart Recommendations**: AI-driven cluster health insights

## Next Steps

The AKS MCP integration is now **fully functional** and ready for use. Users can:

1. Deploy AKS clusters using existing Terraform functionality
2. Immediately transition to deep cluster inspection and management
3. Troubleshoot applications and workloads through the AI interface
4. Perform ongoing cluster operations and maintenance

The Azure AI Agent now provides a **complete Azure infrastructure management experience** from initial provisioning through ongoing operations! ðŸš€
